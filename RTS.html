<p> The bulk of the Dingos roster were returning from last year, a year in whih they bowed out of the playoffs in the quarterfinals to the eventual champions.
This was a team full of rookies last year who took the competition by storm, especially Kobe Andoh who in the first game who exploded for 20 points 5 rebounds
and 5 assist. With the three headed of sharpshooteers Miles Cleveland, Edu Uzodima and Kobe Andoh the Dingos look to build on what they had last year. For more information
